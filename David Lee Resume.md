# David Lee (iOS/Android/Python/TypeScript Developer)

## Summary

I enjoy writing code, and I think I'm a developer who has the ultimate pursuit of writing elegant code,
who also hard-working, motivated, has a keen interest in technology, mobile application, user experience.
As a continuous entrepreneur, there is a certain accumulation of the entire front-end development technology stack.

But now that the business has failed and the funds have broken, I have come out to seek a job with potential and technical challenges.
